# 🎓 School Microservices System

A scalable microservices-based system for managing student and school-related data using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. This system follows modern architectural principles: service independence, centralized configuration, service discovery, API gateway routing, and distributed tracing.

## 🧭 Overview

This project demonstrates a microservices-based architecture for managing school operations. Each service handles a specific domain (e.g., Student, School, Department) and communicates over REST or message queues.

## 🧩 Microservices

| Service              | Description                             | Port   |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|--------|
| `config-server`      | Centralized configuration management     | `8888` |
| `discovery-server`   | Service registry (Eureka)                | `8761` |
| `api-gateway`        | Entry point for all requests             | `8082` |
| `student-service`    | Manages student data                     | `8083` |
| `school-service`     | Manages school and metadata              | `8084` |
| `department-service` | Handles school departments               | `8085` |

> Each microservice has its own database.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```

Client → API Gateway → \[student-service | school-service | department-service]
↘ Config Server
↘ Discovery Server
↘ Zipkin (Tracing)

````

- All microservices register with the **Discovery Server**.
- **Gateway** routes external requests to appropriate services.
- Services pull configs from the **Config Server**.
- **Zipkin** and **Sleuth** enable distributed tracing.
- Optional: Add Kafka/RabbitMQ for async communication.

---

## 🚀 Core Technologies

- Java 17+
- Spring Boot
- Spring Cloud (Eureka, Gateway, Config)
- Spring Data JPA + H2/PostgreSQL
- Lombok
- OpenFeign
- Sleuth + Zipkin
- Docker + Docker Compose (optional)
- Gradle

---

## 🔗 Service Communication

- **Synchronous** via REST:
  - Uses **OpenFeign** clients for inter-service calls
- **Asynchronous** (future):
  - Can be enhanced using **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ**

---

## 🛠️ Centralized Configuration

- All services fetch their configuration from a **Spring Cloud Config Server**
- Config is stored in a Git-based repository (can be local or remote)

Example `bootstrap.yml` for each service:
```yaml
spring:
  application:
    name: student-service
  cloud:
    config:
      uri: http://localhost:8888
````

---

## 🔍 Service Discovery

* **Eureka Server** is used as a **Service Registry**
* All services automatically register and are discoverable by name
* Load-balanced calls via service names instead of hardcoded URLs

---

## 🌐 API Gateway

* Acts as the single entry point to all microservices
* Performs routing, load balancing, and basic filtering

Example route config:

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: student-service
          uri: lb://student-service
          predicates:
            - Path=/api/students/**
```

---

## 🔎 Distributed Tracing

* **Spring Cloud Sleuth** adds trace IDs to logs across services
* **Zipkin** collects and visualizes traces
* Traceability makes debugging across services easy

Start Zipkin on port `9411`:

```bash
docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
```

---

## 💡 Fault Tolerance

* Use **Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker** with **Resilience4j** to:

  * Handle service failures gracefully
  * Provide fallback methods for broken dependencies

---

## ▶️ Running the Project

### Prerequisites

* Java 17+
* Gradle
* Optional: Docker

### Steps

1. Clone the project
2. Start `config-server`
3. Start `discovery-server`
4. Start `zipkin` (optional)
5. Start each microservice
6. Start `api-gateway`

Use `Postman` or a browser to test endpoints:

```
GET http://localhost:8082/api/students
```

---

## 🌱 Future Improvements

* Add Kafka/RabbitMQ for asynchronous events
* Integrate JWT authentication
* Deploy with Docker Compose or Kubernetes
* Add monitoring
